## Installing Environment & Dependencies

To use the scripts in this repository, you must have _Anaconda_ installed on the systems that will be running the scripts. This will simplify the process of installing all the dependencies.

For reference, see: [https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

The package counts with a __Makefile__ with useful functions. You must use this Makefile to ensure that you have all the necessary _dependencies_, as well as the correct _conda environment_. 

* Show all available functions in the _Makefile_

```
$:  make show-help
    
    Available rules:
    
    clean               Delete all compiled Python files
    environment         Set up python interpreter environment - Using environment.yml
    lint                Lint using flake8
    remove_environment  Delete python interpreter environment
    test_environment    Test python environment is setup correctly
    update_environment  Update python interpreter environment
```

* __Create__ the environment from the `environment.yml` file:

```
    make environment
```

* __Activate__ the new environment __{{cookiecutter.conda_python_env}}__.

```
    source activate {{cookiecutter.conda_python_env}}
```

* To __update__ the `environment.yml` file (when the required packages have changed):

```
  make update_environment
```

* __Deactivate__ the new environment:

```
    source deactivate
```

### Auto-activate environment
To make it easier to activate the necessary environment, one can check out [*conda-auto-env*](https://github.com/chdoig/conda-auto-env), which activates the necessary environment automatically.
